            <p >‚≠ê Participation.&nbsp;Participation can appear in many ways. Some folks shine in large groups, some folks shine in small groups. Some folks are active online, some are not. Some folks share vulnerabilities easily while others do not.</p>
            <p >‚≠ê Perspective. Each person lives by their truth. Each person is informed by their own unique upbringing and journey. Listen to understand, not to judge. Lead with curiosity. It is a privilege to hold space for each other.</p>
